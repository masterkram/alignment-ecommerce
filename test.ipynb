The battery is full charge capable, the speakers are loud and clear, and the screen is perfect. The speed is fine for me, but all I do is do basic browsing and watch movies. I previously had a 2017 model, which was garbage compared to these older models. This Macbook actually has ports installed in the unit, so you don't have to buy extra adapters. I've had zero issues connecting my memory cards, however I haven't tried the others. They consist of one HDMI, two USB, headphone, memory card, two thunderbolt, and I believe a magsafe 3 charge port. I prefer those styles that connect magnetically and will disconnect when pulled, instead of pulling your whole computer to the ground. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.\",\n",

       "     'reviewText': 'The thing I was mostly worried about: the battery. When I first opened it, there was a \"service battery\" warning, cycle count was 711 and the percentages were haywire. However, after leaving it charging overnight it went away. I spent a full day playing with it to test the battery and, whilst it holds a charge, it drains a little bit fast without forcing it too much, as a result of its age. So I decided to go for a battery replacement anyway to enjoy it even further, because my unit is really in a pristine condition. Only very few and unnoticeable scratches. Went to Apple for diagnostics, and even the technician was surprised how good the condition was (exterior and interior): everything was working properly. They told me the battery wasn\\'t needing a replacement yet but it was getting there and would be needing it soon. Nonetheless it would be good while the replacement comes, so I was perfectly fine with it! Another thing that I considered important to note is that the charger that comes is only 45W and, while Amazon clearly states that it won\\'t be original (although I think the one that came is), this system needs a 85W one to charge properly. I also just bought another one for peace of mind, but it is an extra cost you should keep in mind (80 bucks). Still, in my opinion, the total cost is very well worth it. If you are still not sure about getting this system, I would say go for it. This specific model is possibly the best Apple made (with the R9 M370X graphics) and still has the SDXC and HDMI ports, a gorgeous Retina display, scissor keyboard and Force Touch trackpad, all for 600 bucks. It won\\'t be an M1, but it runs perfectly (I bought it for Lightroom) and it will cost you almost four times less than the newer Macs with all these ports! I\\'m definitely keeping it for at least another 4 years.',\n",

When I first opened it, I noticed the screen hinge was feeling weird. Most likely it was a bad hinge, or heavily used hinge that’s causing the problem. This is the first thing you experience when using a laptop so I returned it immediately. If it were not the hinge, the exterior has some small dings and dents, but screen looks pretty decent. I would have kept it if the screen hinge was not a faulty one. But I’m glad BuySPRY took care of me.',\n",

The Macbook Pro I received has silver protective stickers on both top and bottom sides to cover some scratches. The charger side corner is damaged but acceptable. Also the screen has a small scratch at left corner but not really noticeable. Well, it\\'s a used Macbook after all. The Magsafe 2 charger inside the package is a new one but it is a fake (real one\\'s charging light has a 2 seconds delay) so I have to order a new one from Apple. Turned it on, no iCloud/Apple ID login issue whatsoever. Everything was wiped clean at factory setting. Kinda surprised the battery life looks great. Keyboard all keys are working, screen has no dead pixels, Touchpad seems fine, both speakers have sound, BT/Wifi works, SD card works. Not much to complain other than the fake charger. However with the newest macOS 12, some apps such as Vivaldi browser seems to be slower than my late 2012 MBP 13 inch (without AMD GPU) running on 10.15.

       "     'reviewText': '*This is an addition to the initial review below. After paying $750 for the screen repair, the hard drive completely crashed a few weeks later while I was in the middle of a project. Because this model has the hard drive soldered to the motherboard it is unrepairable. I bought the computer in October and this happened in March. $1500 plus $750 repair got me 6 months out of a machine. Lesson 1: Get the extended warranty for your laptop . Lesson 2: Don\\'t purchase renewed from these folks. I bought this Macbook Pro at the end of October. I was really excited about the product and value! I did notice the N key was more illuminated than the others and seemed to behave in a \"sticky\" manner, but was willing to overlook this issue for the price. I had good buyer confidence with the 90 day warranty. However, after 120 days the monitor display went out rendering the machine useless. After to taking it to a local shop for evaluation, they said the repair would be $750. I decided to reach out to the company. I called and left a message with a detailed description of the issue. After not hearing back after a week I sent a message via Amazon. After another week I resubmitted the same message which is as follows: Greetings. I purchased this renewed MacBook Pro at the end of October. A few weeks ago the screen randomly stopped working. It won\\'t even work to recognize and connect to a second monitor. I contacted a repair shop. They said it is very common for that model and year for the internal display component to go out. They also said Apple had an extended repair program for those models for those years with that problem. However, this computer is exempt because it is a rebuild. This computer is just outside of the 90 day warranty from my purchase. Is there something that you can and are willing to do to help me out with this situation? I am making monthly payments on a computer that is not working that I\\'ve only had for less than 4 months. Thank you for your time and consideration! I finally, after the third attempt, heard back. They simply told me to contact the warranty company. As you can read in my message the product was already outside of warranty. I was just hoping the company would show some integrity and stand by their product. I am making monthly payments on a machine that lasted less than for months and is now rendered useless unless I shell out another $750. Please be weary when trusting this company with your money.',\n",

The one I got, however, had some pretty heavy scratches all over the bottom side of it. The top, screen, and keyboard are in pretty good condition though, and the battery cycle count is only at two. It's pretty obvious that the computer was used much more than 2 battery cycles so I'm guessing the battery itself was replaced more recently than the computer has been used .

My request for a peripheral keyboard or partial refund was denied, and I was put through the Amazon appeal process. My appeal was denied on the grounds that I was not eligible for a refund -- even though I had never requested one! Products like these are too expensive to risk getting ones that don't work.

       "     'reviewText': \"My long time dream of owning a Macbook has finally come true! It's vintage, according to Apple, bcuz it's 8 years old as of early 2023, but you'd never know it, bcuz it's still supported and running the latest OS next to Ventura, which is Monterey 12.6.3, this thing is pretty fast, and makes making my Youtube videos a snap. The charger works well, the battery life is good, and everything is well! Compared to my base model M1 mac mini that I got 7 months ago, the only difference is that the M1 Mac Mini starts up faster, which is not all that much faster. And this baby actually downloads my videos from Canva and uploads to Youtube faster than my M1 Mac Mini. So, I'm ecstatic with my first ever Apple laptop! I'm using an old wireless mouse with it I had from my previous 2012 Mac Mini, and it's great! I'm not a fan of the track pad and rather use a mouse. So, I highly recommend this early 2015 Macbook Air! Hurry up and get one while it lasts! But just mentioning that I had to download the apple apps, Numbers, Pages, and Keynote from the App store. And the latest update to Monterey. It came with Monterey installed but not the latest version.\",\n",

Also the magnetic charging port had so so much black gunk in it. I haven\\'t decided on keeping it or not. It\\'s a 2015 so maybe I should expect so much and if I can get a good 2 years out of it, it\\'ll be worth it. I was so nervous ordering something like this online, ill update in a month or so and try and up load the pics',\n",

       "     'reviewText': \"My son's original MacBook Pro of 3 years stopped working so we were desperate to get him a computer to finish out his school year. He had the biggest week of projects and needed his computer. We received it, charged it, logged into Apple ID and it wouldn't work then screen went black. We trouble shot but the computer never would work and screen was completely black. Also, they had duct taped the computer to make it appear to not have any blemishes. We pealed off the type and there was a huge scratch on top of it. I will never buy a refurbished computer again!\",\n",

I contacted their support (they were great) and they immediately sent me another computer. However, the replacement computer also has an excessively noisy system fan, and when I went to open the laptop up to look at it, I found that the two screws under the Windows key flap were not the correct screws and wouldn't thread in; they were just sitting loose in the screw holes. Fortunately they're not integral to keeping the computer together. I'll just put in some of my own screws I've got. And regarding the system fan, I'm just going to order a replacement fan and change it myself. So to summarize, I like my computer and it looks and performs great, and wouldn't not order from this vendor again but I would choose another vendor first if I had the opportunity.\",\n",
